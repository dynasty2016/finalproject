The island of Barbados in the Caribbean is currently undergoing an economic structural adjustment, supervised by the International Monetary Fund. One of the sectors expected to fuel growth in the economy is the tourism sector. To this end, an expansion of the room stock in the island is needed to accommodate any increase in long-stay visitor arrivals. Three hotel projects in particular are being examinied but have been stalled due to challenges associated with their locations.

External investors looking to invest in setting up a hotel property in Barbados would need to know where are the best areas on the island for such a project. Depending on whether it is an all-inclusive property or one that depends on having certain amenities in the area, this is information and data that investors will need before making the investment. It will also provide much needed rooms to facilitate more long-stay visitors to the island.
