In this exercise, I will be making calls to the Foursquare API to search for a specific type of venue, to explore a particular venue, to explore a Foursquare user, to explore a geographical location, and to get trending venues around a location. I will also use the visualization library, Folium, to visualize the results. The following necessary libraries will also be imported:

Requests - library to handle requests
Pandas - library for data analysis
NumPy - library to handle data in a vectorized manner
Random - library for random number generation
Nominatim (from the GeoPy library) - module to convert an address into latitude and longitude values
IPython - libraries for displaying images
json_normalize - library for transforming a json file into a pandas dataframe

Examples of use of Foursquare location data:

Samsung
Using Foursquare's database of more than 105 million places, Samsung allows users to geo-tag their photos with detailed info about a destination, while also serving up contextually relevant locations for those who are searching for a place to eat, drink or explore.

Airbnb
The world's largest community-driven hospitality company relies on the Places API to surface curated photos and other place-related content in users' guidebooks.

Uber
The global ride-hailing giant enables users to search and find the destinations they want to go using Foursquare's Places Database of 105+ million places around the world.
